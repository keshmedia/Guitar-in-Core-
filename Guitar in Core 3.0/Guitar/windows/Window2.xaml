           Practicing
w notes about how to approach practicing with the best frame of mind.
First, don’t hurt yourself, especially when you’re just starting. You may be 100%
motivated to learn, but you won’t learn anything if you damage your hand from
overplaying. It’s easy to do that when you start, because your hands simply haven’t built
up the muscles they need to play yet. This is more of a problem with acoustic steel string
guitarists than electric guitarists, because steel string guitars are generally harder to
play. Give it a little time; the hand strength will come.
You’ll want to get some essential tools besides the guitar. Get a metronome, and a
journal. The metronome helps you play in time, but does more than just that. It forces
you to play music, and not rambling notes and chords. Keeping time with the metronome
makes you push yourself beyond your comfort zone, so you can grow as a player.
You say you’re not a writer. That’s okay, but get a journal anyway, and use it to write
down how well you think you’re doing. You don’t need to write in it every day. But when
you’ve spent three weeks working on a song or scale or arpeggio exercise, write down
how it felt to complete it. Also, write down the things you can’t yet do. A year from now,
you’ll look at what you wrote, and feel great pride at how far you’ve come.
Good attitude is crucial to your sense of achievement. Putting yourself down because
you can’t yet make a particular chord shape is not nearly as helpful to you as moving on
to another chord shape, or reviewing the chords you do know. The technique will come,
trust me. Stay motivated by writing your goals down, and rewriting them regularly. Read
how others grew from having no skill, to being players.
Play for others, maybe a little before you believe you’re ready. Smooth your playing on a
song or two, and play them for someone. You’ll get a whole new perspective on your
playing, and what you need to work on. Besides that, any compliments you get will
motivate you in a powerful way.
                                
                                How to Hold the Guitar
Remember to breathe. It’s easy for your body to get tense when you do something as
awkward as playing guitar for the first time. This tenseness builds up without your even
realizing it. Take a break every so often, and just breathe.
Even if you do everything right, playing might seem uncomfortable at first. It should not
be painful, though. If you sense any pain at any time, stop immediately. Before long,
your desire to play will make not holding the guitar feel uncomfortable.
Choose a chair or seat with the right height. You’ll know it’s the right height because,
when you sit, your thigh will be angled just slightly upward. Some players pick any chair
and raise their guitar knee by putting their guitar foot on a stool or stack of phone books.
The point is to raise the guitar high enough so your hand can get to the frets. It gets real
tiring to play by putting your guitar foot on tiptoe all the time. It also gets tiring when you
hunch your entire upper body over so you can see the frets.
If you’re right-handed, put the guitar on your right knee. Note: classical guitarists would
use their left knee. It’s tempting to tilt the guitar so you can see the frets, but don’t do it.
Keep the guitar straight. The neck of the guitar should be angled slightly upward as it
extends away from your body.
Now for the fretting hand. Practice making what I call “the claw“ with your left hand. This
means putting your left thumb halfway between the bottom of the guitar’s neck, and the
top of the neck. It’s tempting to grab the guitar like you were grabbing a hammer, with
the thumb wrapping over the top, but you won’t be able to hit all the notes that way. To
make the claw, keep the thumb at that halfway point on the neck, and crook your wrist
as if you were trying to make your finger tips hook over the top of the neck.
If all of this seems too complicated, go for these simplified instructions: look at pictures
of how other guitarists hold their guitar, and do what feels comfortable for you. By the
way, some great guitarists, such as Jeff Healy, hold their guitar flat on their lap. 
Just like the other aspects of learning the guitar, tuning is something you’ll get better at
the more you do it. The first time you tune, it may be difficult to separate in-tune pitches
from those out of tune. Electronic tuners are available to help with this, but all you need
to start is a set of pitch pipes, or some other source that can emit the pitch called
“Concert A.” You can even use your computer to output this pitch, if you have the right
software.
Let’s tune. Once you have your Concert A source, turn it on or do what you need to do to
make it sound. Holding your guitar as though you were playing it, press your finger onto
the fifth fret of the first string. (The first string is the thinnest one.) You don’t need to
press too hard. The Right Hand
Strumming
Up until now, we haven’t paid attention to the right hand. When you played songs in this
book, you worked out for yourself what the right hand was supposed to be doing. We’re
going to pay closer attention to the right hand in this section, by showing you some
different strumming and picking patterns.
When you do these exercises, it might be helpful to hold the pick just at its edge,
between your thumb and your forefinger, with your whole hand making a loose fist. You
don’t need to make the fist tight, or put a lot of pressure on the pick. The pointy end of
the pick should be free to wobble up and down a bit.
Here’s the most basic strumming pattern. It’s a series of all downstrokes, no upstrokes.
The downstrokes are shown with a down arrow. Melody: Alternate Picking
Let’s take a break from strumming chords, and learn an important tool for playing single,
melodic notes. This will be an important skill when we begin improvising.
We’re going to learn a picking technique called alternating picking, and we’re going to
apply this technique to a scale that’s heard in most forms of popular music: the
pentatonic scale.
Here’s a melodic line to play that uses alternating picking with the pentatonic scale. To
play this correctly, follow the up and downstroke markings on the tablature. It will feel
difficult at first to continue alternating your strokes when you move from one string to
another, but you’ll get the hang of it with practice. Improvising
There’s nothing magical about improvising, except the great feeling you get when you hit
the right notes. In this section we show you how to hit those notes.
Here are the steps we’re going to approach improvising with:
• Record yourself playing chord changes.
• Play back the recording, while you play the pentatonic scale over it.
• Play with the pentatonic scale: pick any notes from the scale you want.
• Change to a minor pentatonic scale to add a blues feeling.
Before you begin doing these steps, you’ll want to practice this set of chord changes
until you’re fairly smooth at it. In fact, using a metronome while you practice would be
helpful to you. Here are the chord changes you’ll improvise over. Play these changes
slowly, with a blues feeling. Playing by Ear
I was tempted to put this chapter in the main body of the book, except that the major
scales are covered in the Appendix, and playing by ear depends on you knowing the
major scale. So, before you tackle this chapter, work through at least one major scale
form in the Appendix.
In this section you’re going to learn to play simple melodies by ear. There’s a lot of
mystique surrounding this ability, but almost anyone can learn how to do it, just as most
everyone can learn how to speak.
First of all, you may want to know how playing by ear helps you. What’s the purpose of
playing by ear? First and foremost, it just feels good when you can hear a piece of music
and play it back. You feel like you are truly connecting with Music itself, and that time
slips away. Also, playing by ear helps you correct mistakes and memory problems when
you go to play a tune. For example, after playing through a new song a couple of times,
your hands might not feel they totally understand the song. But your “ear” may
understand it perfectly. When that happens, your playing smooths out the hitches and
hesitations your hand has.
Those are just some of the reasons to play by ear. Now, let’s figure out what to play.
Chances are, you know dozens and dozens of songs already. You know pop tunes from
the radio and TV. You know nursery rhymes, and maybe some hymns from church or
the synagogue. And you likely also know some tunes for certain holidays. Christmas
songs are especially good for learning how to play by ear, because so many people
know them so well. I want you to have the freedom to choose any song you want, but I
also want to ensure you choose a song with an easy melody. For that reason, I
recommend you choose one of the following Christmas songs:
• Silent night
• O Christmas Tree
• Rudolf the red-nosed reindeer
• Jingle Bells
• God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen (Comfort and Joy)
• The First Noel
• Joy to the World
Also, Amazing Grace
This list will give you a good start with some simple melodies. Choose one of the songs,
and let’s learn to play it by ear.
There’s a long version and short version to explain how to pick out the melody. I
recommend starting with the short version first. It’s lacking in the details of how to find
the melody, but your determination will supply you with those details. The longer version
is the same basic procedure, but contains more detail. If you have a hard time following
either version, consult the resources listed at the end of this section.
